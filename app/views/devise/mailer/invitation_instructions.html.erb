<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>I have created a platform where we can upload the excel sheets from the Tate Shop, and make easier to be tracked.</p>

<p>See below the invitation for <%= link_to 'Wine Shop Orders', root_url %>.</p>

<p><%= link_to t("devise.mailer.invitation_instructions.accept"), accept_invitation_url(@resource, invitation_token: @token) %></p>

<p>You will only have to set up your password to be able to gain access to the website.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Fernando</p>

<p>If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email. Your account won't be created until you access the link above and set your password.</p>
